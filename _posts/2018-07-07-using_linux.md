:exclamation: My story :exclamation:

I bought my first computer :computer: when I was in high school in around 2012 :smile:, it was *Samsung netbook NP/NC-108*, I was really excited about that, I had no idea what programming is, what exactly is *linux OS* or even *Ubuntu*. I have already familiar with *windows OS* and my shiny new computer was pre-installed with *windows 7*, I used my computer just to listen to music, playing some strategy and fun games, watching movies, finding new fun apps, playing/hacking with OS configuration/customization, and also I did graphics design (Photoshop & CorelDraw). I didn't do anything special with my computer, because I was a dumb.

Some day I downloaded *ubuntu OS image* :dvd: version *12.04 LTS (precise pangolin)* at an internet coffe in my town. I was very excited to try it in my computer so I took a risk. At that time I just had very minimum experience on computer technical things, I read lots of tutorials and followed it.

After some point I had successfully installed *ubuntu* :tada:, then the real journey began.

I came across many problems, I didn't know how to install software, play music, videos. One painful thing is I can't play multimedia like music or videos on *ubuntu*, I tried to find out on *google* and found articles and said that I had to install codec first (I didn't know `apt-get update/install` need internet). After quite long time, I've installed the codec and played mutimedia smoothly.

A problem which was really annoyed me was I couldn't use `fn` keyword on my laptop and the *LCD brightness* :sunny: control was broken (I didn't want to use laptop with full brightness at night) :worried:.
The brightness problem was very hard to solved, couldn't found anything that works for me and also I had very limited internet access. After a few days I decided back to use windows on my computer.

Bye Ubuntu! :disappointed:

It was around 2014 when *ubuntu 14.04* was released :tada:. I just graduated from high school and want to pursue my education in a university :mortar_board: (I choose computer science). before I used *ubuntu 14.04*, I've installed several version earlier such as *13.04/13.10* and the result was my netbook didn't strong enough to run the unity desktop environment, it was really heavy (lag) so uninstalled it.
I searched some alternative and came up with *xubuntu 14.04* (like it!).
*Xubuntu 14.04* was the right choice for me, it run very smooth, memory usage was small and one of my hardest problem was gone (the brightness, I think it was from new linux kernel which added support for my intel graphics card), everything runs perfectly and I love it :heart_eyes:.

From then I used xubuntu primarily for daily activity, because my focus in programming it's really easy to program in *linux os (ubuntu)*.

In around 2015 I bought an *Asus* laptop and installed xubuntu 14.04 on it.
Again I faced with the same problem, the `fn` key didn't work. But, at least with my programming knowledge and experience on using linux I made a tool :hammer: to control the brightness with `alt+5 to decrease and alt+6 to increase` instead of using `fn`.
Then I experienced freeze regularly when using linux (every linux distribution), to turn the laptop off I had to forced it by long push the power button.
One night the latest *linux kernel* was released (forgot the version, 4.10 above maybe), I downloaded from ubuntu kernel mainline site and installed on my laptop and fortunatelly from that version the freeze is totally fixed.

From then to now 2018 I use *linux/xubuntu* as my primary os smoothly without any problem, and I use it for my software development activity because it's also fast, lightweight and easier for programming :tada:.

Happy developing, Happy using linux. :smile:
